<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>A flashcard is a digital or paper card that contains a term on one side, and a definition, translation, or explanation of that term on the other. Flashcards are often used for learning foreign languages and are an effective study technique for many people.</p>

<p>For this project, weâ€™ll refer to the text on the front of the card as the term, and the text on the back will be the definition. You will create an application that emulates a set of flashcards on the screen. While developing this application, you will not only learn some programming, but also save paper!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>Implement a program that outputs 4 lines:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The first line is <code class="java">Card:</code></li>
	<li>The second line is the term on the front of the card</li>
	<li>The third line is <code class="java">Definition:</code></li>
	<li>The fourth line is the definition on the back of the card</li>
</ul>

<p>In this stage, the term and the definition can be anything you want.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Examples</h2>

<p>Here are some output examples to clarify what the result should look like.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1.</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Card:
purchase
Definition:
buy</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2.</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Card:
cos'(x)
Definition:
-sin(x)</code></pre>
